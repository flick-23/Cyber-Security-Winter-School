                      <p>As someone once said, 'the show must go on'. Not that this is a show, but amidst the pandemic we must pat our own back for not letting our spirit fall lower and kept going.</p>
                      <p>Yes, we all did experience an unprecedented situation. A virus not visible to the naked eye has put the world on pause but there is something which the virus could not change! Yes, absolutely, one's will power to grow and our determination to play the Game of Life whatsoever.</p>
                      
                      <p> With all the this stored in, we welcome you to <b>BelPy 2021 Call For Proposals</b>. Being the first ever edition of BelPy we invite all the Pythoneers out there to flaunt their knowledge.!</p>
                      
                      <b><p>There are 2 categories of Proposals:</p>

                    <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-center mb-3">Proposal Types</h4>

                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Talks</h5>

                    <p>If you’re going to walk the walk, you have to be able to talk the talk — the ‘Tech Talk’ that is.</p>

                    <p>Technology is becoming more and more important as we move forward, and it is changing our lives in ways that were unimaginable before. Trends such as the Internet of Things are enabling us to monitor and control our environment like never before. Machine learning is enabling computers to decide like—and sometimes better—than humans. End-to-end encryption is giving us (back) privacy that can’t be undermined. Bitcoin and blockchain are revolutionizing the payment industry and domains beyond. Virtual and augmented reality are transforming a host of industries by enhancing the human experience.</p>

                    <p>This is just a glimpse of where technology stands today. A whole lot of exciting opportunities are waiting beyond the horizon.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>At BelPy Talks, we examine trends in technology, how they affect the way we live and do business, and the problems they solve. But we also discuss the evil side of technology, the darker implications of new tech and what we need to look out for.</li>

                      <li>Talks are selected through a CFP (Call For Proposals) process. Interested members of the community propose their talks. An editorial panel designated by the organisers makes the selections. </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Workshops</h5>
                    
                    <p>Hands on learning is as important as talks for a fulfilling conference experience. Like talks, workshops are also conducted by the members of the Python community.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Anyone can propose for conducting a workshop. Any topic of interest to the Python community is okay - the workshop should help attendees learn a new skill, technology or library. </li>
                    
                    <li>In the CFP proposal, please mention an outline of the workshop and the prerequisites. And the slides if possible. Also mention if you have conducted the same workshop before.</li> 

                    <li>The workshop should be interspersed with proper hands-on exercises. After the workshop people should be ramped up on the workshop topic, and should be able to take it forward themselves.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-center mb-3">What To Propose</h4>

                    <p>Anything of interest to Python Community and Python programmers is welcome.</p>

                    <p>To get started, here are a few topics that we feel might be great.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Data Science, Machine Learning and AI</li>
                      <li>Networking and Security - Network Programming, Network Security and Encryption</li>
                      <li>Web - Web development, APIs</li>
                      <li>Frameworks - Django, web2py, Pylons etc.</li>
                      <li>Scientific Computing</li>
                      <li>Community</li>
                      <li>Core Programming</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                      Or did you read some research paper and would like to explain the aspects of it or just enlighten with some views of yours? Yes, feel free to do so!
                      Alternatively, just brainstorm and look around, you might just come up with a great idea that can catch your mind!
                    </p>

                    <p>Presentation goals are usually some of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Introduce the audience to a new topic.</li>
                      <li>Speak of new developments on a well-known topic.</li>
                      <li>Show the audience real-world usage scenarios for a specific topic (case studies).</li>
                      <li>Dig into advanced and relatively unknown details on a topic.</li>
                      <li>Compare different solutions available on the market for a topic.</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Authors should propose their talks using the CFP application.</li> 
                      <li>BelPy members review the proposals for completeness.</li>
                      <li>Once the proposals are ready, they are reviewed by a panel of experts.</li>
                      <li>If the proposal does not look complete, or the reviewers need clarifications, the author is notified via comments.</li>
                      <li>The panel of experts finally vote on the proposals.</li>
                      <li>A pre-final shortlist is eventually prepared based on the votes.</li>
                      <li>The shortlisted proposals go through a round of rehearsals (more details in the section below).</li>
                      <li>A final list is created and published.</li>
                    </ul>

              <ul>
                <li><b>Apply</b></li>
                <p>Even if you have a vague idea, submit a proposal. We're available for help with ideas and feedback (contact information is in the section below). Don't worry about communication skills or English - we are there to help with that too. And our focus is more on the content.
                  Make it detailed</p>
                
                <li><b>Add as much detail as possible to the proposal.</b></li>  
                <p>Add the presentation slides if you already have one. Add a short minute video giving a summary of the proposal. More detail helps reviewers make better judgement.</p>
                
                <li><b>Propose early</b></li>
                <p> We will start the review process as the proposals come in, and not at the end. Proposals submitted early will get more attention and feedback</p>
                
                <li><b>The code of conduct</b></li>
                <p>Take a look at the <a href="code-of-conduct.html">code of conduct</a>, and be mindful of it. The gist is, be nice and avoid using sexist language.</p>
 
                <li><b>Add a preview video</b></li>
                <p>Add a small intro video about what your talk is about to provide a preview to what's to be expected.</p>
